# Use of this is \ (IMPORTANT)
- We use (\) at the start of any special operations like either for  * *, # or etc.., like this. And this implementation will differ from operations. We use this mainly to cancel the implementation of those particular operations. <br>
**Example:** 

> #### # Hi - here this will return the text in h1 tag based 
>
> \ # Hi - this won't retrurn the text in h1 tag based 

- ## Note: 
  - while adding \ (backslash) before the any operation there should not be any space between them.
