# Use of this is \ (IMPORTANT)
- We use (\) at the start of any special operations like either for  * *, # or etc.., like this. And this implementation will differ from operations. We use this mainly to cancel the implementation of those particular operations. <br>
**Example:** 

> #### # Hi - here this will return the text in h1 tag based 
>
> \ # Hi - this won't retrurn the text in h1 tag based 

- ## Note: 
  - while adding \ (backslash) before the any operation there should not be any space between them.

# 1. What is MERMAID ? 
- Mermaid is a tool that lets you draw diagrams using just text inside your Markdown files.

- You don’t need to open Photoshop, Draw.io, or PowerPoint. Just write a few lines of code, and it automatically creates the diagram.

- Think of it like coding your diagram instead of drawing it.
---

# 2. Why do we use it?
- Visualize ideas: Sometimes text alone is confusing. Diagrams help explain processes, workflows, or system designs.

- Easy to maintain: If a process changes, you just update the text, not redraw the whole diagram.

- Works in Markdown: Tools like GitHub, GitLab, Notion, Obsidian support Mermaid. So your diagrams show directly in your README.md or notes.

# 3. When to use it?

- Use Mermaid when you want to:

- Show steps of a process → flowcharts.

- Show how users or systems interact → sequence diagrams.

- Show project timelines → Gantt charts.

- Show class structures in programming → class diagrams.

- Basically any visual explanation in text-based docs.

✅ **In short:**  
Mermaid = **text → diagrams**.  
Use it in Markdown when you want **visual explanations** of your project, processes, or code.
